# Enigma

Enigma is a project that aims to simulate the basic functioning of the [Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) in JavaScript. This was done when I started learning JavaScript. I will add proper documentation and clean up the code if I get time.

Currently, there are 3 rotors, and a reset button to bring back the initial state of key mappings/rotor positions. The keyboard, plugboard and lightboard are functional. The plugboard could do with some visualizations on which keys are actually plugged together after you click on them, so I guess I'll do that as well when I get to cleaning this code *one day*.

Used [Greyscale](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) for styling the page.
